    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Alex Bashara. I am currently a Senior at Iowa State University majoring in Computer Engineering. I plan to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering 
        in December of 2024. I am extermely interested in new technologies and embedded systems. I also have a passion for cars and am the Electrical Team Lead on the  Formula SAE team at Iowa State. 
        I love to learn and gain experience in different fields and am always up to new challenges.</p>

        <h3>Real-Time Telemetry System</h3>
        <p>When I joined the Cyclone Racing Formula SAE Team in 2021, the team had never had a wireless telemetry system. Another engineer and I set out to build one. In the first year, we managed to create
            a basic AVR based system that was able to collect data from the ECU, send it wirelessly in real time, and display it on a computer. In the second year, we improved the system by creating a custom 
            PCB as well as adding a dash display for the driver and a new sensors such as brake temp and accelerometers. In the third year, we moved the system to an ARM based platform, creating custom microcontroller
            PCBs. This allowed us much more control over the funcionality of the system as well as allowed us implement a RTOS to help manage our Real-Time requirements.

        <h3>Simulated MIPS VHDL Processor</h3>
        <p>For this project, my group and I were tasked with creating three different architectures for a MIPS Processor: a single cycle structure, a software pipeline, and a hardware pipeline. We started 
            with the single cycle architecture by creating a VHDL file for each component of the processor. We then moved on to the software pipeline, which was a bit more challenging. We had to create a
            control unit that would be able to handle the different stages of the pipeline. Finally, we moved on to the hardware pipeline. This was the most challenging part of the project. We had to create
            a control unit that would be able to handle the different stages of the pipeline. We also had to create a forwarding unit to handle data hazards.

        <h3>Vivado Projects</h3>
        <p>One of the classes that I choose to take was Embedded Systems Design. In this class, other engineers and I were tasked with creating multiple FPGA based projects including an NES Emulator, Drone 
            Controller, Camera System, and an Embedded Linux Driver. For these projects we used a Zynq 7000 SoC and Vivado to create the projects. We also used the Xilinx Vitis SDK to write the embedded software.
            This class was a great learning experience and I was able to learn a lot about embedded systems and FPGA design.

        <h3>Multicore Interfence Analysis</h3>
        <p>This project was my senior desgin project that was overseen by Boeing. The goal of this project was to identify architectural interfence channels, bound the worst case execution time, and show how 
            effective different interference mitigation techniques are in a Xen hypervisor. We used a multicore ARM processor and ran multiple tasks on it to see how they would interfere with each other. We 
            used a combination of open source tools as well as some self written programs to stress the system and monitor the performance.
