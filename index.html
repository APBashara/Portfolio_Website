    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Alex Bashara. I am currently a Senior at Iowa State University majoring in Computer Engineering. I plan to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering 
        in December of 2024. I am extermely interested in new technologies and embedded systems. I also have a passion for cars and am the Electrical Team Lead on the  Formula SAE team at Iowa State. 
        I love to learn and gain experience in different fields and am always up to new challenges.</p>

        <h3>Real-Time Telemetry System</h3>
        <p>When I joined the Cyclone Racing Formula SAE Team in 2021, the team had never had a wireless telemetry system. Another engineer and I set out to build one. In the first year, we managed to create
            a basic AVR based system that was able to collect data from the ECU, send it wirelessly in real time, and display it on a computer. In the second year, we improved the system by creating a custom 
            PCB as well as adding a dash display for the driver and a new sensors such as brake temp and accelerometers. In the third year, we moved the system to an ARM based platform, creating custom microcontroller
            PCBs. This allowed us much more control over the funcionality of the system as well as allowed us implement a RTOS to help manage our Real-Time requirements.
